                <h2>Steps</h2>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat a griddle pan over a high heat. Meanwhile, place the chicken thighs between two sheets of greaseproof 
                            paper, then bash with the base of a heavy pan to roughly ½cm thick. Pop into a bowl, sprinkle over 
                            the paprika, cumin and a lug of oil, and season well with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li><br>
                        <li>Mix well to coat, then place the chicken onto the hot griddle. 
                            Cook for 10 minutes, or until 
                            charred and cooked through, 
                            turning halfway. Leave to cool slightly.</li>
                        <li>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the garlic. Pick the coriander leaves and set aside, 
                            then finely slice the stalks. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat, 
                            add the garlic and coriander stalks and fry for 1 minute.</li>
                        <li>Drain, rinse and add the beans, then fry for a further few minutes. Add the rice and cook for 5 minutes, 
                            or until crisp and piping hot through, stirring occasionally. 
                            Finely grate in the lime zest, roughly chop and add half the coriander leaves. Stir well and remove from the heat.</li>
                        <li>Roughly chop the tomatoes and trim and finely slice the spring onions, 
                            then add to a bowl with the juice of the lime. Roughly chop and add the remaining coriander leaves, mix well and season to taste. 
                            Shred the lettuce and cooled chicken.</li>
                        <li>Pop a tortilla onto the griddle for 1 minute to soften, then place onto a board. 
                            Spoon one-quarter of the fried rice and beans along the middle, 
                            top with a generous spoonful of salsa, a handful of lettuce and one of the shredded chicken thighs. 
                             Grate over some cheese and add a spoon of yoghurt.
                            </li>
                        <li>Wrap up the burrito, then tuck in. Repeat with the remaining ingredients, serving as you go.</li>
                    </ol>
